#Movie App - Phase 1 (multiple classes )

Our client RetFlix wants BEWD students to develop an app.

They want an application that allows visitors to:

*	Add a new movie to the database.
*	Edit a movie in the database.
* View one movie in the database via the show page
* View all movies in the database
*	And search for a specific movie
*	BONUS - Add 'actor' and 'genre' resources
* BONUS Squared - Add a resource 'user' with authentication, 'ratings' and 'review' resources
* BONUS Cubed - Sexify it using the Bootstrap Framework

We will build a Rails app for RetFlix during lesson 10 - 12. Each lesson we will add more functionality to the app.
Pairing is sharing, and happy coding :)
